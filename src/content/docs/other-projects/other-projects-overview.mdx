We enjoy experimenting on “what is possible” to make with our assets. From suggestions and requests we received, we have created those tools/modules to answer some of them. We would love to keep working on these but we focus our attention on our main project above all else when time gets short.


## Token Animator

Here is the teaser video that serves as an overview of what it's about.  
Available on our Patreon from the Epic tier and above, you can download it from the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/64188575">Epic Master Post on Patreon</a>

  <Aside type="note" title="Only-Video Guide">
    We decided to make a video series to explain how to use this tool, there probably won't be a written guide.

## Extra - Free module
When the licensing is restrictive, we simply add the assets in this little module for free. We decided to set them apart from our “main” collection in order to avoid the confusion about some assets being available in our free module but not in our Patreon one.

## Music Puzzle

This little music puzzle module is a free, simple, fun encounter-type idea. Players have to guess a sequence of 4 notes to open a door.  
What does the door open to? Maybe just the exit from that strange room or maybe it leads to a secret room? Ultimately, that's up to the GM setting this puzzle up!  
The module has been updated and is now compatible with FoundryVTT V12 and sounds have also been added!  
It requires the Patreon version of JB2A, even an older version.  
We'd like to expand on the idea but animations take priority!
