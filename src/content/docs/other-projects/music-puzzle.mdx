## Puzzle Objective

Players need to repeat the sequence of notes in the exact same order by walking on each note and then walking on the pressure plate to check their answer against the solution.
By default, a failure will reset the pattern and the GM can spawn a creature of their choice whereas a success will open the doors for the players to escape/access another room.

The first time a player steps on the pressure plate, a sequence of notes will play above the pressure plate in the middle.

This sequence of notes will be inscribed in a GM-only journal.  
The players then have to remember the sequence and input it in their shared journal by stepping on the correct tiles in the same order. 

When the players think they have the right sequence, one of them can step on the pressure plate once more to check if they have the correct answer.  

If the pattern is the same, the doors will open (any door with the tag "jb2a_puzzle"). 
If the "reset pattern" setting is turned on, the players will only have a few seconds (determined by the countdown setting) before the door closes again and a new pattern starts once more. I'm sure you'll find a clever way to split the party!😈

#### Setup the Scene

<video  controls ><source src={ videoguidesetup } type="video/webm"></source></video>


  <Aside type="tip" title="Music Track">
    *Music track is ``Deadlock``, by <a href="https://www.purple-planet.com/">Purple Planet Music</a>* 
  </Aside>

<Steps>

    1. Once the module is activated, open the settings and peruse through the options. Keep in mind that wall creation and musical scale are two options that will require a full reset because tiles and walls are only configured during setup.

    2. You'll notice in your Journals tab that two journal entries have been added. Players will only have access to the player entry. (Also, if you add players after the setup, you'll need to give them permissions to it)
    That's it, the puzzle is ready. You can move the tiles around, change the texture of the pressure plate, move the doors, delete one of them or even copy paste one of these doors if you want/need.

    3. When a player steps on the pressure plate, they will see and hear a new pattern. They need to replicate this pattern by stepping on the correct note tiles, which will fill their journal entry with their "guess". 
    
    4. You can now increase the number of notes in the pattern from the settings so the first or next pattern will be harder to remember if you so wish. 

    5. Also, you have the option to spawn an enemy to fight when the pattern the players entered is wrong (careful, the enemy will also trigger the tiles!). If you have an actor ready, you can just add its name into the settings. Copying the uuid from a compendium actor will also work. Leaving this field empty will skip this functionality.


</Steps>

#### Cleanup

Once finished, you can go to the module's settings and click on the cleanup button. This will delete everything related to the puzzle only.

#### Additional Notes

The sounds provided in the module are from the <a href="https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html">University of Iowa Musical Instrument Samples</a>

It's a good improvement on what the module was originally, but more importantly, it should be easier to expand and bring different ideas of puzzles!  
If you have an idea and would like to contribute, please let us know in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m)  
I'd love to add:  
- Different Puzzle/Ciphers
- Add some settings for more custom configuration:
    - ~~sequence of 5 notes or more for increased difficulty for example~~
    - ~~an option to change the musical scale for all music notes. The GM could choose from a dropdown or input the scale themselves. Right now it's in a basic C major scale, picked at random over 5 octaves.~~
    - ~~Replace the macros by buttons in the settings and make it entirely script-based instead. It would make the setup much easier and straightforward, despite removing some freedom of customization perhaps, for the more code-oriented people.~~
- Maybe make an actual piano-like design with a pitch up/down an octave.
- Bring some more instrument sounds like a guitar, harp, violin/cello, maybe Peri from PSFX would be interested in a collab? 😉 (This is being discussed and we'll work on it as a side-project!!)
