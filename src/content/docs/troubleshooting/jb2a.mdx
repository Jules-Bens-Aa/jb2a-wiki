#### Manifest/download links, where ?

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

    All the download links for our content are on the **Master Post** of our **Patreon page**.

    <Aside type="caution">
      You must have subscribed to one of our tiers to have access to the Master Post. A custom pledge does not give you access to our Patreon content. We recommend that you do not use a custom pledge.
    </Aside>    
    
    Alternatively, you can find the link to access it on this Wiki, on each of our public posts about our releases on Patreon, and on each of our release announcements on our Discord server.

#### No access to the Master Post

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

    This usually means one of your payments has been declined, in which case, the best course of action is to wait for a few days, until Patreon tries to re-process the payment and your status can be cleared.

    <Aside type="caution">  
      Make sure you haven't signed for a custom pledge. A custom pledge does not give you access to our Patreon content. We recommend that you do not use this method.

## Modules


### Issues during Download
#### With manifest link

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

    It’s possible we made a mistake but make sure you follow the steps in our installation guide first to make sure you’ve done it correctly.

#### Too long, stops

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  It’s possible your internet connection is either too slow, your router gets micro-disconnections or the server we use to share the files is far away from where you live. Whatever the case, the manifest link might not be the ideal solution for you.
  
  Try the alternative download link to install it manually on our [Master Post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/jb2a-master-post-56246490). If it still takes too long, you might want to try a download manager like [Persepolis](https://persepolisdm.github.io/).

#### No Patreon assets, only free

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  Uninstall the free module, you don’t need it anymore. Once you have the Patreon module **installed** and **activated** in your world, all your setup using the database paths will be flawlessly transferred over. 
  
  Any tile or token you have setup using file paths may break though. If you don’t have many, you can fix them yourself manually or we can provide a macro in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m) to fix all of them with a batch macro.

  ```txt title="File path example" "JB2A_DnD5e" "jb2a_patreon"
  ### Free module
  modules/JB2A_DnD5e/Library/Generic/Creature/Bite_01_Regular_Red_400x400.webm
  ### Patreon module
  modules/jb2a_patreon/Library/Generic/Creature/Bite_01_Regular_Red_400x400.webm
  ```

  ```txt title="Data path example"
  ### For both modules
  jb2a.bite.400px.red
  ```

#### Tiles, tokens and macros broken

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  You should use Sequencer database paths for macros whenever possible, as it would work for both the free and the patreon module. 
  
  We can provide a batch macro in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m) to fix tokens, tiles and macros if you need however.

  ```txt title="File path example" "JB2A_DnD5e" "jb2a_patreon"
  ### Free module
  modules/JB2A_DnD5e/Library/Generic/Creature/Bite_01_Regular_Red_400x400.webm
  ### Patreon module
  modules/jb2a_patreon/Library/Generic/Creature/Bite_01_Regular_Red_400x400.webm
  ```

  ```txt title="Data path example"
  ### For both modules
  jb2a.bite.400px.red
  ```

#### Can't drop animations on scene

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

There’s a known issue with the [Drag Upload](https://github.com/amir-arad/FoundryVTT-Drag-Upload) module where it breaks the webm animations being dragged on the canvas to create a tile.

Deactivating this module will solve the problem.

</details>

#### Tiled template texture

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  By default, placing an image or an animation directly as a template texture looks “tiled”. The [Token Magic FX (TMFX)](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/) module does fix this behaviour. 
  
  There are alternatives using the Sequencer module, for example, to place the animation on top of the template, or even attach the animation to it, using a macro or another module like Automated-Animations.

</details>

#### No sounds

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  We only provide visuals, no sounds.

  If you have asked yourself this question, we strongly recommend that you read the following two sections to gain a better understanding of what you can expect from the content of JB2A.

</details>

#### Weird animations on template

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  The [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/) module, or TMFX, provides some PIXI filter overlay on templates, linked to damage types. 
  
  You can remove this feature by either disabling the module or opting out of this feature in the module’s settings

</details>

#### Sequencer Database error

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  If we made a mistake in our Sequencer database, please report it to us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m) so we can fix it for the next release. Thank you!

</details>  

#### Black square instead of animation

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

  It could be the browser you use, we’ve had reports of Firefox having this issue with some webms. 
  
  The VP9 codec for Webm files is usually more efficient but we’ve had some unpredictable behaviour using it and other programs using Unity don’t support them, so we tend to steer away from it and we aim to convert our remaining VP9 animations to VP8.
