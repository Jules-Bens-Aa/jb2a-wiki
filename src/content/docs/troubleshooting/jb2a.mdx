#### Manifest/download links, where ?

<details>

  <summary>...</summary>

    All the download links for our content are on the **Master Post** of our **Patreon page**.

    <Aside type="caution">
      You must have subscribed to one of our tiers to have access to the Master Post. A custom pledge does not give you access to our Patreon content. We recommend that you do not use a custom pledge.
    </Aside>    
    
    Alternatively, you can find the link to access it on this Wiki, on each of our public posts about our releases on Patreon, and on each of our release announcements on our Discord server.
