## ... troubleshoot an issue yourself

These steps are designed to suit a wide range of problems. Some steps may be unnecessary in your case, but these are solid guidelines to follow whenever you're trying to solve a problem you've encountered while using our content.

Select the corresponding tab related to your issue.

<Tabs>

    <TabItem label="JB2A Modules">

        <Steps>

            1. Non-Chromium browsers (such as Firefox, Opera, Safari) are known to cause issues. Use a Chromium based browser like Chrome or Edge.

            2. Sometimes, refreshing the page, re-starting the server or re-installing the module with the issue can be enough. It's worth a try.

                - Windows: `F5` to refresh or `CTRL + F5` to refresh and clear the cache.
                - MacOS: `CMD + R` to refresh or `SHIFT + CTRL + R` to refresh and clear the cache.

            3. Check for any updates that might be available for the module you are having issues with and all of its dependencies. It's usually safe to update your modules.

                <Aside type="caution">
                You have to be careful with **game system updates** and **major updates** for FoundryVTT, as the module developers have to play "catch-up" with potentially breaking changes. When in doubt, **always make a backup of your data first**.

                </Aside>

            4. Have you forgotten to enable the module in the world?

            5. Is there an error in the console when you trigger the macro or item? Errors are red, yellow ones are deprecation warnings and are safe for you to ignore.

                To open the console in FoundryVTT:
                - Windows: Press `F12`
                - MacOS: Press `Option + CMD + J`

                If you do have an error, **please include a screenshot when reporting it**.

            6. Make sure you try with only the required modules activated. It's often easier to do so in a fresh new world.

                You would need at least these modules activated:
                - JB2A module, Free **or** Patreon
                - Sequencer
                - Socketlib _(Sequencer dependency)_
                - Any other module required for your automation

            7. The Github page for each module is, almost always, the best source of information about the module. That's where the information is most up to date and you can see when the last update to the module occured.

                    2. Check if the animation is enabled and activate "Customize Item" if you want this item to have its own animation. 

                        <p align="center">
                            <Image src={aaItemMenu} alt="Item menu of Automated Animations" style="width: 25%;"/>
