## The Forge
#### Can't Update

From time to time you will need to refresh your pledge to be able to update our Patreon module on The Forge.

#### Assets location

Our assets are not in the usual place. In the FoundryVTT file picker, look in The Bazaar tab.

#### Assets missing

It's probably because you're looking in the wrong place. There are several tabs accessible via the file picker. Look in The Bazaar tab.

#### Account linked but can't download module

Even after linking your Patreon account to The Forge, you may need to refresh your pledge before you can install the Patreon module. guides#patreon-module

#### Manifest link

On The Forge, you shouldn't have to install our modules using the manifest link. Our modules are installed via The Bazaar. The advantage is that it won't count against your data quota, and what's more, installation is virtually instantaneous!
