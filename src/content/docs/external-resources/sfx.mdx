### Specialised Websites

#### <a href="https://tabletopaudio.com/" >Table Top Audio</a>
A website with a collection of atmospheric background audio/music, especially for tabletop games.

#### <a href="http://www.freesound.org/" >Free Sound</a>
Collaborative database of creative-commons licensed sound for musicians and sound lovers.

#### <a href="https://www.pond5.com/" >Pond 5</a>
Music, sound effects, motion graphics, and images.

#### <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/" >Sap Splat</a>
You can grab some really good, free, sound effects with this. You can pay for some if you want, but I've found their free sounds to work just fine.

#### <a href="https://voicechanger.io/" >Voice Changer</a>
You record something. Then run it through this online changer and check what it produces. You can then save it.

### Sound Archives

#### <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/" >BBC free library</a>
The BBC Sound Effects Archive is available for personal, educational or research purposes. There are over 33,000 clips from across the world from the past 100 years.

#### <a href="https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc" >Game Audio GDC</a>
Royalty free sound effects archive.

## Online Paid Resources

#### <a href="https://battlebards.com/" >Battlebard</a>
It has been mentioned as being a good resource, although it's not free and can ramp up pretty quickly.

## From games that you own
You can copy the files from video games that you own. Usually old games as newer ones tend to encrypt their files. A few examples were : 

- NeverWinter Nights 1 & 2
- Diablo 1 & 2
- FFXIV
- Hades 
- MTG Arena 
- Skyrim
- Baldur's Gate 3

 <Aside type="danger" title="Important">
 `.WAV` and `.MP3` are to be avoided in FoundryVTT. The `.OGG` format for sound is the best as far as we know. You can use a free program like [**Audacity**](/external-resources/useful-tools#audacity) to convert, and it should be possible to batch the process.
