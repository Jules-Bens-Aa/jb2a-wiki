You can grab some really good, free, sound effects with this. You can pay for some if you want, but I've found their free sounds to work just fine.

## Online Paid Resources

#### <a href="https://battlebards.com/" target="_blank">Battlebard</a>
It has been mentioned as being a good resource, although it's not free and can ramp up pretty quickly.

## From games that you own
You can copy the files from video games that you own. Usually old games as newer ones tend to encrypt their files. A few examples were : 

- NeverWinter Nights 1 & 2
- Diablo 1 & 2
- FFXIV
- Hades 
- MTG Arena 
- Skyrim
- Baldur's Gate 3

 <Aside type="danger" title="Important">
 `.WAV` and `.MP3` are to be avoided in FoundryVTT. The `.OGG` format for sound is the best as far as we know. You can use a free program like [**Audacity**](/external-resources/useful-tools#audacity) to convert, and it should be possible to batch the process.
