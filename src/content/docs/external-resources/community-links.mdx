## Foundry VTT

If you didn't already know, this is the virtual tabletop we use. We found it very functional and inexpensive for how awesome and flexible it is, but it does require a bit of computer knowledge to be used correctly. However, it's very well documented, has lots of game systems, can be customised thanks to modules and a very friendly and active Discord server.

## Foundry VTT Modules and Developers

<Aside type="danger" title="Keep in mind">
Most of these developers are working on their modules in their free time, for free, and are NOT affiliated with JB2A.
</Aside>  

### Automated Animations
**Made by Otigon**

A user interface module for Sequencer. It allows you to configure a set of pre-configured animations using JB2A, which are automatically (hence the name) recognized through the item's name. You can do this through Automated Animations' menu through the module settings.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
Automated Animations is currently in maintenance mode. This means there will be no major changes or new features added.

### Sequencer
**Made by Wasp from [Fantasy Computerworks](https://fantasycomputer.works/)**

This module is the back-end for both of the modules listed above, and is the thing that actually plays the effects on the game canvas. You can write your own macros to play effects through its easy-to-use coding style that even novices can learn, but it is much more hands-on than the options above.
