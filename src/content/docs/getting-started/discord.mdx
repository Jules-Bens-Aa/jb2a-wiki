*Some useful things to know about how Discord works*

Our Discord has become one of the main platforms to talk about animation, especially in Foundry VTT.
We've created a small home for a few developers that have created modules around the subject of animation. 
That's why we have so many channels! We've created categories to make it clearer and if you've read the Prerequisites and Understanding Animation, you should get a better picture.

- Discord is the best place to get in touch with us!

## Channels and Roles
During the onboarding, the first time you join the server, you can choose which channels you might be most interested in. You can always join or quit channels later by clicking on the “Channels & Roles” button at the top.


## Opting Roles for Notifications
Having joined many Discord servers ourselves, we understand how notifications can become quickly disruptive or even annoying if overdone. We have decided to create an “opt-in role” system where you can choose which subjects you'd like a notification about. 
The only time we'd use the ``@everyone`` notification is for important notices or we really want to share something with you.


## Search function
The search function on Discord can be quite useful, once you know how to use it.
When you click on the search field in Discord, plenty of options appear that can help you restrict the search to specific user, channels, date...etc

## Syntax Highlighting
Discord uses the Markdown language and you can use Syntax Highlighting. Here's how:


<div style="background-color: var(--jb2a-grey-300);">
    \`\`\`js<br></br>
    Code here<br></br>
    \`\`\`
</div>

Let's have a look at a simple example. If you write this exactly in a Discord post: 

<div style="background-color: var(--jb2a-grey-300);">
\`\`\`js <br></br>
const text = "Hello World";<br></br>
Console.log(text);<br></br>
\`\`\`
</div>



It would then appear in Discord like so:
```js
const text = "Hello World";
Console.log(text);
```
