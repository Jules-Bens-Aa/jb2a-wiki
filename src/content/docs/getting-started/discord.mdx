*Some useful things to know about how Discord works*

Our Discord has become one of the main platforms to talk about animation, especially in FoundryVTT.

We've created a small home for a few developers that have created modules around the subject of animation. That's why we have so many channels! We've created categories to make it clearer and if you've read the Prerequisites and Understanding Animation, you should get a better picture.

## Channels and Roles
During the onboarding, the first time you join the server, you can choose which channels you might be most interested in. You can always join or quit channels later by clicking on the “Channels & Roles” button at the top.

## Patreon Exclusive Roles

How to enable your Patreon roles:

<Steps>

  1. Go to your Patreon account settings.

  2. Click on "More" and then, the "Connected Apps" option.

  3. Once you've connected your Discord account here, you should be assigned your role automatically in our Discord server, corresponding to the tier at which you've joined.

  4. It may take a moment. Try restarting the Discord application.

</Steps>

## Opt-in Roles for Notifications
Having joined many Discord servers ourselves, we understand how notifications can become quickly disruptive or even annoying if overdone. We have decided to create an “opt-in role” system where you can choose which subjects you'd like a notification about. 
The only time we'd use the ``@everyone`` notification is for important notices or we really want to share something with you.


## Search function
The search function on Discord can be quite useful, once you know how to use it.
When you click on the search field in Discord, plenty of options appear that can help you restrict the search to specific user, channels, date...etc

## Syntax Highlighting
Discord uses the Markdown language and you can use Syntax Highlighting. Here's how:

````
```js
Type or Paste your code here
```
````

Let's have a look at a simple example. If you write this exactly in a Discord post: 

````
```js
const text = "Hello World";
Console.log(text);
```
````

It would then appear in Discord like so:

```js
const text = "Hello World";
Console.log(text);
```
