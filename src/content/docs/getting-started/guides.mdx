## How to install

### Free module

The free module could be considered a demo of our module on patreon. We're working hard to ensure that the module has all the animated assets we've made, minus their colour variations and a few exceptions to comply with licensing requirements.

It's a good place to start, if you want to discover the whole FoundryVTT effects environment before committing yourself to our Patreon module. Simple to install, and can be updated directly on FoundryVTT.

The installation process may differ depending on your hosting method. Select the corresponding tab below.

<Tabs syncKey="hostingMethod">

### Patreon module

Our Patreon module **has all the assets** we've produced since the early days of JB2A, with a few exceptions to comply with licensing requirements. Currently, the zip file size is around 6.5GB. 

The installation process may differ depending on your hosting method. Select the corresponding tab below.

<Tabs syncKey="hostingMethod">

  <TabItem label="Self-Hosting">
    <Steps>
      1. You must have an account and [subscribe to any tier](https://www.patreon.com/c/jb2a/membership) on our Patreon. They all have access to the same module.

  <TabItem label="Foundry Server">
    Credits and thanks to ``WWQuicksilver (Rob)`` on Discord for this guide! 
    This post is to assist anyone using the Foundry Server hosting site and Digital Ocean (or similar S3 bucket service for asset storage). It assumes you're NOT using the manifest option because you don't want to eat up ~6GB directly on Foundry Server, and are instead uploading the entire package to your S3 bucket.
    <Aside>
    Using the manifest would actually temporarily require twice the size of our module since FoundryVTT downloads the zip, installs the module and then finally deletes the zip.
    </Aside>
      <Steps>
        1. Create a folder on the root (easiest option) of your S3 bucket called `jb2a_patreon` (case sensitive).

        2. From wherever you've unzipped the contents of the complete JB2A package, go into the `jb2a_patreon` folder and copy the entire Library folder over to your `jb2a_patreon` folder on your S3 bucket. Because the Library folder and its subfolders are large in size and the number of files, you quite likely will need to upload it in smaller chunks...while maintaining the directory structure **AND** making sure to mark the files as public during the process. Attention to detail here will save you time and frustration later. 😉

        3. Validate you can access/view some of the webm files via the tile browser

        4. Install just the free version of JB2A on your Foundry Server instance of FoundryVTT and then shut the FVTT instance down so you can safely update some files (Hit the red Game Control button on Foundry Server).

        5. Using your SFTP tool of choice (e.g. FileZilla), find the `/Data/modules/JB2A_DnD5e` folder and rename it to jb2a_patreon. Then replace the contents of every subfolder (except Library) with the files from your JB2A package.

        6. Restart FVTT, launch your world, and enable JB2A.
        
        7. In Configure Settings select JB2A and in the JB2A - location field enter the full path of your S3 bucket, including `https://`, as in this example (no slash at the end): 
        
                ```
                https://mygame123.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com 
                ```

        8. If you're using Automated Animations, in its settings for the JB2A Asset Location field enter the same thing, plus this at the end `/jb2a_patreon`. example:

                ```
                https://mygame123.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/jb2a_patreon 
                ```

  <TabItem label="Molten Hosting">
      Credits and thanks to `Tyreal2012` on Discord for this guide! 

      Depending on what tier/plan you opt for in Molten Hosting (MH), you may not have enough space to host all the files, the module being 6GB+ in size! On top of this, if you use the manifest link like in the Self-Hosting section, you will need twice that temporarily as Foundry VTT downloads the zip and installs the module and only once the install goes through does it delete the zip.
      This means the "Basic Plan" will not be enough, you'll need at least the "Pro Plan" or "Elite Plan", or you could alternatively use Digital Ocean or an AWS bucket to host only the `Library` folder. See the steps for Foundry Server to see how that's done.

      <Steps>
        
        1. Download the "Complete Collection" zip from the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/56246490/">Master Post</a> on the JB2A Patreon.

            <p align="center"><Image src={jb2aPatreonMasterPost} alt="Preview of the Master Post" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

        2. Extract it on your local hard drive.

        3. Open up the Cloud Commander (CC).

            <LinkButton href="https://molten-hosting.notion.site/Managing-Server-Files-df96be0dcde74775994a86c844ba1a4e" icon="external">How to access the Cloud Commander</LinkButton>

        4. In CC, navigate to the `Data/modules` folder.

        5. Create a folder inside called `jb2a_patreon` (case-sensitive) and open it.

        6. Drag all files except the `Library` folder from the extracted zip (Step 2) into the CC. 

        8. Create a folder called `Library`. The `Library` folder is very large and needs to be uploaded little by little. So, this means upload the `1st_Level`,`2nd_Level` folders one by one.  CC, for whatever reason, seems to have issues with large quantities of files in one go.

        7. The Generic folder is also very large at around 5GB in size, so create a folder called `Generic` and upload in small batches into this folder.

        8. Once you have uploaded all of the files, restart your Foundry instance.

        9. You're done! You can activate our module in your world and browse the assets using the Sequencer Database Viewer!

## How to use

### JB2A + Foundry VTT core

What is described in this subsection applies to any game system and without additional modules. In other words, with the FoundryVTT core.

Our assets are in the `Library` folder in our modules. Once in the FoundryVTT `data` folder, you'll find them in this location: 

<FileTree>

- data
  - modules
    - jb2a-moduleName
      - artwork/
      - **Library/**
      - packs/
      - scripts/
      - module.json
  - systems/
  - worlds/

</FileTree>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Tiles" icon="star">

    To use an animated asset as a tile to a FoundryVTT canvas, follow the instructions on the official website.

    <Aside title= "What is a Tile?">
    If you don't know what a tile is on FoundryVTT, we encourage you to read the first `Overview` section of their documentation.
    </Aside>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tokens" icon="moon">

    To use an animated asset as a token on FoundryVTT, follow the instructions on the official website. The information you need can be found in the ‘Token Configuration Options -> The Appearance Tab’ section.

    <LinkButton href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/" icon="external">FoundryVTT Macros Documentation</LinkButton>

    Depending on the game system you're using, you won't necessarily have to use macros to do the most basic automation, such as triggering an animated effect when a player takes an action on their character sheet.

    <Aside>
    The Sequencer module, created by Fantasy Calendar, makes it much easier to write macros to create effects from our animated assets. We'll talk more about this later.
