## How to install
This is the recommended way to install either the free or the Patreon JB2A module.
### Free module

The free module could be considered a demo of our module on Patreon. We're working hard to ensure that the module has all the animated assets we've made, minus their colour variations and a few exceptions to comply with licensing requirements.

It's a good place to start, if you want to discover the whole FoundryVTT effects environment before committing yourself to our Patreon module. Simple to install, and can be updated directly on FoundryVTT.

The installation process may differ depending on your hosting method. Select the corresponding tab below.

    Credits and thanks to ``WWQuicksilver (Rob)`` on Discord for this guide! 
    This post is to assist anyone using the Foundry Server hosting site and Digital Ocean (or similar S3 bucket service for asset storage). It assumes you're NOT using the manifest option because you don't want to eat up ~6GB directly on Foundry Server, and are instead uploading the entire package to your S3 bucket.

    <Aside>
    Using the manifest would actually temporarily require twice the size of our module since FoundryVTT downloads the zip, and only deletes it once the installation process is completed.
    </Aside>
    
        <Steps>

            1. Create a folder on the root (easiest option) of your S3 bucket called `jb2a_patreon` (case sensitive).

            2. From wherever you've unzipped the contents of the complete JB2A package, go into the `jb2a_patreon` folder and copy the entire Library folder over to your `jb2a_patreon` folder on your S3 bucket. Because the Library folder and its subfolders are large in size and the number of files, you quite likely will need to upload it in smaller chunks...while maintaining the directory structure **AND** making sure to mark the files as public during the process. Attention to detail here will save you time and frustration later. 😉

            3. Check that you can access/view some of the webm files via the tile browser

            4. Install just the free version of JB2A on your Foundry Server instance of FoundryVTT and then shut the FVTT instance down so you can safely update some files (Hit the red Game Control button on Foundry Server).

            5. Using your SFTP tool of choice (e.g. FileZilla), find the `/Data/modules/JB2A_DnD5e` folder and rename it to `jb2a_patreon`. Then replace the contents of every subfolder (except Library) with the files from your JB2A package.

            6. Restart FVTT, launch your world, and enable JB2A.
        
            7. In Configure Settings select JB2A and in the JB2A - location field enter the full path of your S3 bucket, including `https://`, as in this example (no slash at the end): 
        
                ```
                https://mygame123.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com 
                ```

            8. If you're using Automated Animations, in its settings for the JB2A Asset Location field enter the same thing, plus this at the end `/jb2a_patreon`. example:

                ```
                https://mygame123.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/jb2a_patreon 
                ```

        Credits and thanks to `Tyreal2012` on Discord for this guide! 

        Depending on what tier/plan you opt for in Molten Hosting (MH), you may not have enough space to host all the files, the module being 6GB+ in size! On top of this, if you use the manifest link like in the Self-Hosting section, you will need twice that temporarily as FoundryVTT downloads the zip and installs the module and only once the install goes through does it delete the zip.
        This means the "Basic Plan" will not be enough, you'll need at least the "Pro Plan" or "Elite Plan", or you could alternatively use Digital Ocean or an AWS bucket to host only the `Library` folder. See the steps for Foundry Server to see how that's done.

        <Steps>
        
            1. Download the "Complete Collection" zip from the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/56246490/" >Master Post</a> on the JB2A Patreon.

                <p align="center"><Image src={jb2aPatreonMasterPost} alt="Preview of the Master Post" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

            2. Extract it on your local hard drive.

            3. Open up the Cloud Commander (CC).

                <a href="https://molten-hosting.notion.site/Managing-Server-Files-df96be0dcde74775994a86c844ba1a4e" >How to access the Cloud Commander</a>

            4. In CC, navigate to the `Data/modules` folder.

            5. Create a folder inside called `jb2a_patreon` (case-sensitive) and open it.

            6. Drag all files except the `Library` folder from the extracted zip (Step 2) into the CC. 

            8. Create a folder called `Library`. The `Library` folder is very large and needs to be uploaded little by little. So, this means upload the `1st_Level`,`2nd_Level` folders one by one.  CC, for whatever reason, seems to have issues with large quantities of files in one go.

            7. The Generic folder is also very large at around 5GB in size, so create a folder called `Generic` and upload in small batches into this folder.

            8. Once you have uploaded all of the files, restart your Foundry instance.

            9. You're done! You can activate our module in your world and browse the assets using the Sequencer Database Viewer!

## Manual Install

### FoundryVTT Data Folder

You need to know the location of FoundryVTT's data folder. There are two ways to locate it:

    - If you have the App installed, you can right-click the FoundryVTT icon in your taskbar and choose `Browse to User Data`.
    - Otherwise, on the home page of FoundryVTT,

        <Steps>
    
            1. click the gear icon to change the configuration settings,
    
                <p align="center"><Image src={fvttLandingPageSettings} alt="FoundryVTT Settings - Datapath setting location" style="width: 50%;"/></p>
    
            2. and the User Data folder path will appear there.
    
                <p align="center"><Image src={fvttDataPath} alt="FoundryVTT Settings - Datapath setting location" style="width: 50%;"/></p>
    
        </Steps>

### Steps

If you're having issues with the manifest link for whatever reason or you have downloaded the "Complete Collection" zip as a backup and need to re-install our module, here's how.

<Aside title= "Note">
This only concerns the Patreon module as you shouldn't have to install our free module this way.
</Aside>

<Steps>

    1. Download and Extract the "Complete Collection" zip somewhere on your hard drive.

    3. Inside the Data folder, open the ``modules`` folder.

    4. Create a folder called **exactly** ``jb2a_patreon``. It's case-sensitive.

    5. Back to our extracted zip, we want to drag the files inside over to the newly created ``jb2a_patreon`` folder. The file transfer might take a while, it's a large amount of data! 
    Once finished, it should look like this:

        <FileTree>
      
        - data
          - modules

### Patreon module

<Tabs syncKey="hostingMethod">

    <TabItem label="Self-Hosting">

        There are two ways of updating our module:

        ##### Method 1

        The first is simple but has its drawbacks.

        <Steps>

            1. First, shutdown your FoundryVTT Server.

            2. Delete the old version of our module.

            3. Then follow the installation steps described in this section.

                <LinkCard title="Install Patreon Module" href="/jb2a-wiki/getting-started/guides#patreon-module" />

        </Steps>

        ##### Method 2

        The second method requires a little more handling. But it's quicker because you only download what's been added to the old version. This method is the most efficient in terms of download time and bandwidth usage.

        <Steps>

            1. First, shutdown your FoundryVTT Server and go to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/56246490/" >Master Post</a>.

                <p align="center"><Image src={jb2aPatreonMasterPost} alt="Preview of the Master Post" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

            2. Look for the `Only New Stuff` section.

            3. Download the `.zip` file(s) you need, to catch up with the latest version of our module.

            4. Repeat the following steps depending on the number of `.zip` files you have just downloaded. In the order of publication:

                <Steps>

                    1. Open the zip file.
                    2. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file into our module located in the FoundryVTT `data` folder. By default our module should be located in `data/modules/jb2a_patreon` and inside it should look like this:

                        <FileTree>

                        - data
                          - modules
                            - **jb2a_patreon**

                          - worlds/

                        </FileTree>

                    3. Overwrite all the files when you are asked to do so.

                </Steps>

            5. Start your FoundryVTT server. Our module should now be update to date.

        </Steps>        

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Foundry Server">

        Follow the instructions in the `Self-Hosting` tab. We recommend method 2, but we don't know the exact details. You will need to adapt the steps accordingly.

        [FoundryVTT Macros Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/)

        Depending on the game system you're using, you won't necessarily have to use macros to do the most basic automation, such as triggering an animated effect when a player takes an action on their character sheet.

        <Aside>
        The Sequencer module, created by Fantasy Computerworks, makes it much easier to write macros to create effects from our animated assets. We'll talk more about this later.

### JB2A + Automated Animations

#### Trigger your first effect

Before embarking on this step, read the “Prerequisites” and “Understanding Animation” secions first or you'll be missing the basics to understand what you're doing.

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard title="Prerequisites" href="/jb2a-wiki/getting-started/prerequisites" />
    <LinkCard title="Understanding Automation" href="/jb2a-wiki/getting-started/understanding-automation" />
</CardGrid>

This step-by-step guide is for the **DnD5e gaming system**. Some things may be different depending on the game system you wish to use. If Automated Animations is compatible with your game system, only the character sheet part will need to be adapted.

<LinkButton href="https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction" icon="external" variant="secondary">List of compatible game systems for Automated Animations</LinkButton>

##### Requirements

To follow this guide, here's what you need:
- FoundryVTT
    - A world for the DnD5e game system.
- Modules
    - Sequencer from Fantasy Computerworks.
    - Automated Animations from Otigon.
    - Our Free or Patreon module.

These modules must be installed with their dependencies. FoundryVTT will alert you when this is the case. Make sure they are all updated. Then all these modules must be activated in your world.

##### Versions

Here are the different versions used to produce this guide. You don't need to have exactly the same versions. However, you should be aware that there may be some differences depending on the versions you use.

<p align="center"><Image src={guideFvttVersion} alt="Version of FoundryVTT and D&D5e game system used in this guide" style="width: 50%;"/></p>
<p align="center"><Image src={guideModulesVersion} alt="Versions of modules used in this guide" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

<Aside>
The version of our Free or Patreon module is not important for this guide.
</Aside>

##### Scene setup

<Steps>

    1. First, import two actors from the SRD compendium and drag and drop them onto the canvas. We'll use `Akra` as the Player Character and an `Acolyte` as the Non-Player Character.

        <p align="center"><Image src={guideCompendiumActors} alt="Actor Compendiums from the D&D5e game system" style="width: 50%;"/></p>
        <p align="center"><Image src={guideTokenCanvas} alt="Canvas on FoundryVTT with 2 tokens" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

    2. Automated Animations has a number of animated effects already configured. There are only a few of them and they serve as a reference. To access the Automated Animations menu, which we'll call the Autorec menu from now on:

        <Steps>

            1. Go to the `Settings` tab.

            2. Click on `Configure Settings`.

            3. Then select Automated Animations in the sidebar.

            4. And click on `Launch Menu`.

                <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaSettings} alt="Accessing the Automatic Recognition Menu" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

        </Steps>

    3. Explore the Autorec Menu. There are various tabs for creating or customising effects (Melee - Active Effects), Settings, and Diagnostics (to help you troubleshoot any problems).

        <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaExplore} alt="Automatic Recognition Menu" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

    4. **Quick Tip:** To simplify access to the menu, Automated Animations provides a macro allowing you to open this window directly from the hot bar.

        <Steps>

            1. At the top of the Autorec Menu window, click `Settings`.

            2. At the bottom of this window, there is an area called `Automatic Recognition Menu Macro`, click on the area and drag the macro into the hot bar.

            3. To return to the Autorec Menu, you can now either:
                - Close the window and use the macro,
                - or click on `Main Menu`.

                <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaMacro} alt="Automatic Recognition Menu, Settings Window" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

        </Steps>

    5. Back on the canvas, with `Akra`, we're going to attack the `Acolyte` with his mace.

        <Steps>

            1. First, target the Acolyte,

            2. then, select Akra.

            3. Finally, trigger the attack from his character sheet. 

            4. The animation should be triggered after rolling the dice. You've just triggered your first animated effect!

                <p align="center"><video  controls muted="true" ><source src={ guideAaMaceAttack } type="video/webm"></source></video></p>

        </Steps>

    6. But why stop there? Now, move `Akra` a few dozen feet away from the `Acolyte`, check that he still has his target and make an attack with the light crossbow. An animation should be triggered when you roll the dice.

        <p align="center"><video  controls muted="true" ><source src={ guideAaCrossbowAttack } type="video/webm"></source></video></p>

    7. Then try Fog Cloud. The animation should be triggered after you place the template on the canvas.

        <p align="center"><video  controls muted="true" ><source src={ guideAaFogCloud } type="video/webm"></source></video></p>

        In this case, there are two options for deleting the template: Click on the Template tool in the FoundryVTT left-hand toolbar and delete the template.

        <p align="center"><video  controls muted="true" ><source src={ guideAaFogDelete01 } type="video/webm"></source></video></p>

        Alternatively, go to the Sequencer Manager, the button on the left-hand bar of FoundryVTT. This is where you'll find all the persistant animation on the Canvas. Then go to the template tool to remove the template from the canvas.

        <p align="center"><video  controls muted="true" ><source src={ guideAaFogDelete02 } type="video/webm"></source></video></p>

    8. Finally do the same thing with Inflict Wounds. Normally, if you have exactly the same setup, there are no animations after triggering the attack. This is perfectly normal!

    9. Open the Autorec menu and look at the melee tab. You'll see that the Mace is there. All our melee attack animations must be configured in this tab to work correctly.

        <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaMelee} alt="Automatic Recognition Menu, Melee Tab" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

    10. Then go to the Range tab, and you'll see that there's only the Crossbow preset and not Light Crossbow. This is because Automated Animations has recognised part of the name of the weapon and used this effect. All our ranged attack animations must be configured in this tab to work correctly.

        <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaRange} alt="Automatic Recognition Menu, Range Tab" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

    11. In the Template tab, you'll find Fog Cloud. This is where all spells/abilities similar to it must be configured. Whether it's a square, circular, conical template, etc... 

        <p align="center"><Image src={guideAaTemplate} alt="Automatic Recognition Menu, Template Tab" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

    12. Inflict Wounds is a bit special. It could be possible to configure it in the melee tab but also in the On Token tab, depending on the animations you want to use. This was simply to illustrate what follows.

    13. Automated Animations has very few pre-configured animated effects. These are generally called Effects. Depending on the game system you are using, there are several options available to you:

        - If you are using D&D5e, you can install the D&D5e animations module made by Vauxs among others. It can be downloaded and installed via FoundryVTT directly.

        <LinkCard title="D&D5e Animations" href="/jb2a-wiki/external-resources/community-links#dd5e-animations" />

        - If you are using PF2e, you can install the PF2e Animations module or the PF2e Graphics module, which is currently under development. They can be downloaded and installed via FoundryVTT directly.

        <CardGrid>
            <LinkCard title="PF2e Animations" href="/jb2a-wiki/external-resources/community-links#pf2e-animations" />
            <LinkCard title="PF2e Graphics" href="/jb2a-wiki/external-resources/community-links#pf2e-graphics" />
        </CardGrid>

        - For other game systems, you can join our Discord server, in the channel #aa-autorec-sharing,  where people may have shared their presets. For example Cyberpunk and Warhammer.
