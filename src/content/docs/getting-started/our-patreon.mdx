Patreon is a subscription-based platform that connects content creators with either existing fans or those looking for creative projects to support.

The support from our patrons makes it possible for us to continue creating the best animations we can and give it all our attention and focus. 

When you subscribe to any of our tiers, you'll be able to download all our assets at once, which represents at least four years of work, more than 6GB of assets! 

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
There are two ways to get our content, on [Github](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JB2A). If you find it somewhere else, please let us know on Discord. With the exception of The Forge, where you can install **and** update both of our modules from The Bazaar.

### Per Creation

We renamed it “Per Release”. This system means that you'll be charged when we publish a release, up to your maximum pledge and you still get access to our Master Post, and thus all our new assets, as long as you're subscribed.

The maximum pledge makes it possible for you to support us further, if we publish more than one release per month. It is not required and won't limit your access however.
- If we don't publish anything in a given month, no one gets charged at all (which has only happened once in four years).
- If we publish more than one release within a month, you will get charged each time (the amount of your selected tier), up to the maximum pledge you have set.


#### About the Uncommon tier

We could have deleted the “Uncommon” tier after a while but we decided to keep it for people that are not as financially comfortable or if they live in a country where the exchange rate makes it very expensive, like Brazil for example. People still do come and go from this tier so you might still be able to join. 

### Master Post

When you subscribe to any of our tiers on Patreon, you'll get access to the [**Master Post**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/56246490/), where you can find the manifest link and downloads.

### Custom pledge

A “Custom Pledge” is something Patreon put in place for people who want to support creators **without any of the benefits**. We recommend one of our tiers instead, to have access to the Master Post.

### Billing

Transparency is key for us to build a trust relationship with you. It's only fair that we need to create stuff for you to support us! We have to create and release posts to make money and you spend however much you want or are comfortable with at any point in time. You can change tier, modify your maximum pledge or even cancel your pledge and rejoin us at any moment. Patreon charges all members that are subscribed to a tier when a release is published and debits patrons on the first of each month for the content released the prior month. 

### Cancelling

Thank you for your support! Before doing so, be sure to download our latest release from our Master Post. With the Complete Collection zip stored somewhere on your hard drive, you'll be able to install our module manually.
