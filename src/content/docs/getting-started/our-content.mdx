## How to install

### Free module

The free module could be considered a demo of our module on patreon. We're working hard to ensure that the module has all the animated assets we've made, minus their colour variations and a few exceptions to comply with licensing requirements.

It's a good place to start, if you want to discover the whole FoundryVTT effects environment before committing yourself to our Patreon module. Simple to install, and can be updated directly on FoundryVTT.

The installation process may differ depending on your hosting method. Select the corresponding tab below.

### Patreon module

Our Patreon module **has all the assets** we've produced since the early days of JB2A, with a few exceptions to comply with licensing requirements. Currently, the zip file size is around 6.5GB. 

The installation process may differ depending on your hosting method. Select the corresponding tab below.

<Tabs syncKey="hosting method">

  <TabItem label="Self-Hosting">
    <Steps>
      1. You must have an account and subscribe to any tier on our patreon. They all have access to the same module. To find out more about how our Patreon works, click here.

          <p align="center"><Image src={jb2aPatreonHomePage} alt="Patreon homepage of JB2A" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

      2. Find the [Master Post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/jb2a-master-post-56246490), it's a pinned post in the “Home” section. It will always be at the top of the list of recent posts.

            <p align="center"><Image src={jb2aPatreonMasterPost} alt="Preview of the Master Post" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

      3. Consult the Master Post section called "Download Links".
      4. Under “Manifest Link”, right-click on the link and “Copy Link Address”.
      5. Go to the FoundryVTT landing page,

            <p align="center"><Image src={fvttLandingPage} alt="Landing Page of FoundryVTT" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

      6. and click on the “Add-On Modules” tab.

            <p align="center"><Image src={fvttAddOnModules} alt="Add-On Modules Tab on FoundryVTT" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

      7. Finally, follow the instructions on their official documentation [Installing a module with a Manifest URL](https://foundryvtt.com/article/modules/). Once the installation is done, you can uninstall the free module, as it won’t be needed.

            <p align="center"><Image src={fvttAddOnModulesInstall} alt="Researching JB2A in the 'Install Module' window" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

      8. We recommend to lock our Patreon module to prevent FoundryVTT to update it when you update all your modules. Otherwise you'll receive an error from our Patreon module each time you try to update it.

            <p align="center"><Image src={fvttModuleOption} alt="Researching JB2A in the 'Install Module' window" style="width: 50%;"/></p>

### JB2A + Foundry VTT core

To help you understand why you'll need additional modules to automate animated effects, let's start with what you can do in FoundryVTT without them. What is described in this subsection applies to any game system and without additional modules. In other words, with the FoundryVTT core.

We'll come back to this in more detail later, but our assets are in the `Library` folder in our modules. Once in the FoundryVTT `data` folder, you'll find them in this location: 

<FileTree>

- data
  - modules
    - jb2a-module
      - **Library/**
      - scripts/
      - module.json
      - README.md  

</FileTree>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Tiles" icon="star">

    To use an animated asset as a tile to a FoundryVTT canvas, follow the instructions on the official website.
    [FoundryVTT Tiles Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tiles/)

    <Aside title= "What is a Tile?">
    If you don't know what a tile is on FoundryVTT, we encourage you to read the first `Overview` section of their documentation.
    </Aside>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tokens" icon="moon">

    To use an animated asset as a token on FoundryVTT, follow the instructions on the official website. The information you need can be found in the ‘Token Configuration Options -> The Appearance Tab’ section. 
    [FoundryVTT Token Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tokens/)

    <Aside title="What is a Token?">
    If you don't know what a token is on FoundryVTT, we encourage you to read the first `Overview` section of their documentation.
    </Aside>

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Macros" icon="moon">
    
    This method requires a __good knowledge of javascript__ to be able to do just about anything with our assets. To find out more about what a macro is on FoundryVTT and how to use them, read the documentation provided on their official website.
    [FoundryVTT Macros Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/)

    Depending on the game system you're using, you won't necessarily have to use macros to do the most basic automation, such as triggering an animated effect when a player takes an action on their character sheet.

    <Aside>
    The Sequencer module, created by Fantasy Calendar, makes it much easier to write macros to create effects from our animated assets. We'll talk more about this later.
