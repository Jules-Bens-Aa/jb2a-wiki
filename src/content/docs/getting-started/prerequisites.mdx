Our main focus is to create animated assets and do our best to provide interesting and cool content. Creating VFX requires a wide range of skills that demand our full attention. 

### About Automations

Fortunately, other talented module creators, independent of JB2A, have developed effective ways of making the most of our content. These modules are highly recommended if you're looking for a quick way to create automations.
