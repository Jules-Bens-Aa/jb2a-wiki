## Create an Issue on Github
You will notice an “Edit page” at the bottom of every page in this website. Clicking it will bring you to the document in the Github Page of the project. 
The “issues” tab in Github is where all your suggestions can be made, typos, broken links…etc can be reported and logged so we can track what changes need to be made and discuss them with you.
