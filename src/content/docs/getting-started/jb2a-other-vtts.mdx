## Compatibility
Check that your Virtual Tabletop accepts videos in the webm format.
If you know it uses a Unity-based system, it should work for at least 90% of our animations. 
Unity only accepts VP8 encoded webm files and we have converted a lot of our Vp9 encoded files we initially created for the sake of size/quality efficiency in certain circumstances.

## The Library Folder
You can download the "Complete Collection" zip from the Master Post on Patreon.

Once extracted, you'll find a folder inside called ``Library``. This folder contains all of our animations in webm format. This is all you need for other Virtual Tabletops. 
Our focus has been on FoundryVTT because of the capabilities it offers in terms of animation. If other VTTs offer a way to use our animations other than just place a tile down, we'd love to know about it! 

## Reach Out!
Please feel free to reach out to us with information about how you use our assets in your Virtual Tabletop of choice. We'd love to hear about it, and add some details on this page on how to install/upload and use our assets.
