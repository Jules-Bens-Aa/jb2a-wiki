### Par Création

We renamed it “Per Release”. This system means that you’ll be charged when we publish a release, up to your maximum pledge and you still get access to our Master Post, and thus all our new assets, as long as you’re subscribed.

#### Tiers

### Master Post

When you subscribe to any of our tiers on Patreon, you’ll get access to the Master Post, where you can find the manifest link and downloads.

### Engagement Personnalisé

A “Custom Pledge” is something Patreon put in place for people who want to support creators **without any of the benefits**.

We do not recommend to use Custom Pledge.
