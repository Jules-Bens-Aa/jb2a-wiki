We enjoy experimenting on “what is possible” to make with our assets. From suggestions and requests we received, we have created those tools/modules to answer some of them. We would love to keep working on these but we focus our attention on our main project above all else when time gets short.

## Extras
When the licensing is restrictive, we simply add the assets in this little module for free. We decided to set them apart from our “main” collection in order to avoid the confusion about some assets being available in our free module but not in our Patreon one.
You can install the module by copying this manifest link and pasting it within FoundryVTT (follow the same steps as the [Patreon Module installation via manifest link](getting-started/guides#patreon-module))

Alternatively, you can download the files from the <a href="https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/jb2a-extras" target="_blank">Github Project</a> by pressing the
